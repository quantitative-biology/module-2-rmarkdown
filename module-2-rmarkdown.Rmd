# Introduction to Rmarkdown

## Motivation

```{r setup2, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = "")
```

Say you get some tree data from a colleague, and spend a month writing lots of
R code to analyse the data. Your code also produces beautiful figures and tables,
that you then manually copy into a Word document. You have also written lots of
text, and include specific calculated numbers in the text, such as the simple

`The average tree height was 10.1 m.`

Then your colleague sheepishly tells you that someone found an error in some of
the data, and so you need to redo everything. Your heart sinks with the prospect
of re-running all your code and making sure you manually copy the correct new
figures into your document. Oh, and you need to redo the tables and check all
the numbers in your text.

The alternative modern approach is to use Rmarkdown. The idea is that you can
generate a 'dynamic report'. You write code that contains a
mixture of your R code _and_ your write up. You can use this for short analyses,
scientific manuscripts, or even a complete thesis.

This introduction, aimed at biologists, will get you started with the
basics. You will then be in a good position to learn more details from the
[RStudio introduction](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) and the
online [Definitive Guide to Rmarkdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown ).

**Example application**

A recent 328-page document we wrote in Rmarkdown is [A reproducible data synopsis
for over 100 species of British Columbia
groundfish](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-sccs/Publications/ResDocs-DocRech/2019/2019_041-eng.html).
For each of 113 species, we produced two pages of figures:

![](../module-2-rmarkdown/images/silvergray.jpg){width=120%}

For each species, the layout of the figures is identical (even to show no data
when none are available). Producing each figure and manually inserting them into
a Word document would be extremely tedious. Instead, the production of the
document is automated using Rmarkdown.

Furthermore, the work is transparent and traceable. Because the code produces
  the figures (they are not pasted in from somewhere), we can trace back from
  the Rmarkdown code to see the R code that:

* pulled the data from databases
* fit models
* generated plots.

In particular, we intend to periodically update the document as new data become
available. While still a lot of work, it is less daunting knowing that the
code is already available.

On a practical level, the report has allowed anyone to see the data available,
and has consequently increased data transparency between Fisheries and Oceans Canada, the
fishing industry, non-governmental organizations, and the public.

This is admittedly a _very_ advanced example with a ton of code (several new R
packages) and work behind it, but the idea is to show you what is possible.

## Basic idea

In the above tree example, if using Word, for example, you would have a sentence
that says

`The average tree height was 10.1 m`

The "10.1" is hard-wired into your text, and you typed it on from the value
"10.1" that your R code calculated (in a variable you calculated, let's say you
called it `avge_height`).

In your Rmarkdown document you have your R code _and_ your text write up. You
would equivalently have:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
The average tree height was `r avge_height` m
```

Instead of "10.1" you refer _directly_ to the variable `avge_height` that you
have already calculated. When you 'render' your Rmarkdown document (convert it
from code into .pdf, .html or other formats), it
automatically fills in the `avge_height` value as "10.1". The
```{r, eval=FALSE}
`r
```
means that the next bit of code (until the next backtick) should be evaluated
using R, and the result inserted.

This is the basic idea. Then, when your colleague mentions the error (or, say,
provides you with extra data) you can just re-run your
code and the "10.1" will be automatically updated in your document. This concept
extends to your tables and figures -- they can all be automatically updated.

## Simple example

Here we will generate some data, show some of it in a table, plot it, and show
the results of fitting a simple linear regression. Read through this and then
you will download and run the code in the exercise.

**Generate data**

First we'll need some libraries:
```{r rmarklibs, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
library(dplyr)
library(xtable)
```

Now generate some data:

```{r generate}
set.seed(42)
n <- 50                      # sample size
x <- 1:n
y <- 10*x + rnorm(n, 0, 10)
n
```

So we are showing our R code here (we can choose to
hide it if we like), and it has been executed, yielding the printed output of
the value of `n` (because of the final line of the code).

We can also embed results from R within sentences, for example:

We have a sample size of `r n`.

This is done (as mentioned above) by the code:
```{r eval=FALSE}
We have a sample size of `r n`
```

We can also automatically say that the maximum value of the data is `r max(y)`, or round it to a
whole number: the maximum value of the data is `r round(max(y))`. These were done by:
```{r eval=FALSE}
the maximum value of the data is `r max(y)`

the maximum value of the data is `r round(max(y))`
```

**Show some of the data**

Let's combine the data in a tibble (think of it as a data frame if you don't
know what that is):

```{r showdata}
data <- tibble(x, y)
data
```

(only the first 10 rows get printed here thanks to dplyr).

To have a proper table, we can do
```{r kable}
kable(data[1:10,],
      caption = "The first rows of my data.")
```

(If you're running the code separately the exact style may look different
because of settings we have, but pretty much everything is tweakable with the
`kable` and `kableExtra` packages).

**Plot then fit a regression data**

Now to plot the data:

```{r plot}
plot(x, y)
```

To fit and then print the summary regression output from R:

```{r regression}
fit <- lm(y ~ x)
print(summary(fit))
```

And for a report we can produce a simple table (including a caption) of output and the regression fit:

```{r fit}
kable(coefficients(summary(fit)),
      caption = "Linear regression fit.")
```

And create a plot:
```{r plotfit}
plot(x, y)
abline(fit, col="red")
```

**Now, let's go back and change the data**

The *big* feature of dynamically generating reports is when you go back and
change or update the input data. For example, changing the data in the above
example and then re-running it to redo the report. The best way to demonstrate
this is for you to do it in the following Exercise.

### Exercises

1. Download [this file]() TODO onto your computer and put it where you want to
   work on this exercise.

1. The file is an Rmarkdown (`.Rmd`) file that you run by either clicking
   the `knitr` button in RStudio or doing `rmarkdown::render("****.Rmd")`
   in R. TODO check these.

1. Check that this has produced a `.pdf` file document that looks similar to what you
   see above (don't worry if the styling is not identical, but the important
   content should be). Note that the `.Rmd` file is _not_ repeating explanations
   of how to do certain things TODO reword.

1. Copy the `***.pdf` to `****-orig.pdf`, change `n` to 30 in `***.Rmd`,
   and re-run it.

1. Compare the two `.pdf` files. You have done the same analyses but on
   different data.

1. You can even get a bit clever with your writing by including an R `ifelse`
statement to somewhat automate the text. Here is the results of some code (that
will be included in the file):

So the maximum value of $y$ is `r round(max(y))`, which is
`r ifelse(max(y)>400, paste("greater than"), paste("less than"))`
the special value of 400. The "greater than" or "less than" part is given by
```{r swanky, eval=FALSE}
`r ifelse(max(y)>400, paste("greater than"), paste("less than"))`
```

But you have to be careful and think about all possibilities -- what if
$y=399.9$?

1. In exploratory analyses it is helpful to include your R code so you can see
what you have done. But for a manuscript you just want the results. The
big individual chunks of R code are called 'chunks'. TODO: to just show the
results and not the R code, change TODO

**Explain cache**

TODO - check if it's like this or not (it won't be, depends on settings I do):

1. Look at `knitr-cache-tex/` folder, order files by 'Date modified'.

2. Re-run this file. Look at the times of those files.

3. Change $n$ back to 50.

4. Re-run this file. Again look at the times of the files in `knitr-cache-tex/`.

So `knitr` caches results of each chunk, but then re-runs those that have
changed (or those that depend on something that has change).

Very efficient -- if you just update some text you don't need all the
calculations redone.

Beware - if you read in, say, a `.csv` file and the contents of the file change,
`knitr` will still use the cached read-in of that file, because it won't know
that the file has changed.

If you're not sure then it's safest to delete the `knitr-cache-tex/` directory
to re-run all calculations (including loading in of data).
