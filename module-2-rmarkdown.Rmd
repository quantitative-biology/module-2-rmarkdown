# Introduction to R Markdown

This module consists of text, example code and two exercises to
get you started using R Markdown.

## Motivation

```{r setup2, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = "")
```

Say you were sent some tree data from a colleague, consisting of lengths and diameters
of some trees repeatedly measured over 30 years. You then spent a month writing lots of
R code to analyse the data. Your code also produces beautiful figures and tables,
that you then manually copied into a Word document. You also had to write lots of
text, including calculations such as the simple

`The average tree height was 10.1 m.`

Then your colleague sheepishly tells you that someone introduced an error when
extracing the data from their tree-size database, and so
you need to redo everything. Your heart sinks with the prospect
of re-running all your code and making sure you manually copy the correct new
figures into your document. Oh, and you need to redo the tables and check all
the numbers in your text.

The alternative modern approach is to use R Markdown. The idea is that you can
generate a 'dynamic report'. You write code that contains a
mixture of your R code _and_ your write up all in one place. You can use this for
short analyses, scientific manuscripts, or even a complete thesis. For shorter
documents you will have a single R Markdown file, and for more complex documents
it's better to break your work up into individual files that are linked
together, such as chapters for a thesis.

This module is aimed to get biologists started with the
basics without too much extraneous information. Having gone through this module
you will then be in a good position to learn more details from the
online [Definitive Guide to R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown){target="_blank"}
and the [RStudio introduction](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html){target="_blank"},
which are aimed at a general statistical audience (rather than specifically biologists).

A key concept is that everything is written as code. You do not have to manually
point and click anything, or copy and paste figures between directories. So once
you understand how something works or have figured out some formatting that you
like, you can just copy that code and use it elsewhere.

**Example application**

A recent 328-page document we wrote in R Markdown is [A reproducible data synopsis
for over 100 species of British Columbia
groundfish](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-sccs/Publications/ResDocs-DocRech/2019/2019_041-eng.html){target="_blank"}.
For each of 113 species, we produced two pages of figures:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "First example page showing multiple figures of data.", width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("silvergray-rockfish-1.png")
```

and

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "Second example page showing multiple figures of data.", width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("silvergray-rockfish-2.png")
```

Do not worry about the details -- the point here is that for each species the
layout of the figures is identical (even to show no data
when none are available). Producing each figure and manually inserting them into
a Word document would be extremely tedious and time-consuming. Instead, the production of the
document is automated using R Markdown.

Furthermore, the work is transparent and traceable. Because the code produces
  the figures (they are not pasted in from somewhere), we can trace back from
  the R Markdown code to see the R code that:

* pulled the data from databases
* fit models
* generated plots.

In particular, we intend to periodically update the document as new data become
available. While still a lot of work, it is less daunting knowing that the
code is already available.

On a practical level, the report has allowed anyone to see the data that are available,
and has consequently increased data transparency between Fisheries and Oceans Canada, the
fishing industry, non-governmental organizations, and the public.

This is admittedly a _very_ advanced example with a ton of code (several new R
packages) and work behind it, but the idea is to show you what is possible and
what you can work towards.

## Basic idea

In the above tree example, if using Word, for example, you would have a sentence
that says

`The average tree height was 10.1 m`

The "10.1" is hard-wired into your text, and you typed it on from the value
"10.1" that your R code calculated (in a variable you calculated, let's say you
called it `avge_height`).

In your R Markdown document you have your R code _and_ your text write up. You
would equivalently have:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
The average tree height was `r avge_height` m
```

Instead of "10.1" you refer _directly_ to the variable `avge_height` that you
have already calculated. When you 'render' your R Markdown document (convert it
from code into .pdf, .html or other formats), it
automatically fills in the `avge_height` value as "10.1". The
```{r, eval=FALSE}
`r
```
means that the next bit of code (until the next backtick) should be evaluated
using R, and the result inserted.

This is the basic idea. Then, when your colleague mentions the error (or, say,
provides you with extra data) you can just re-run your
code and the "10.1" will be automatically updated in your document. This concept
extends to your tables and figures -- they can all be automatically updated.

## Simple example

Here we will generate some data, show some of it in a table, plot it, and show
the results of fitting a simple linear regression. Read through this and then
you will download and run the code in the exercise.

**Generate data**

First we'll need some libraries:
```{r rmarklibs, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
library(dplyr)
library(xtable)
```

Now generate some data:

```{r generate}
set.seed(42)
n <- 50                      # sample size
x <- 1:n
y <- 10*x + rnorm(n, 0, 10)
n
```

So we are showing our R code here (we can choose to
hide it if we like), and it has been executed, yielding the printed output of
the value of `n` (because of the final line of the code).

We can also embed results from R within sentences, for example:

We have a sample size of `r n`.

This is done (as mentioned above) by the code:
```{r eval=FALSE}
We have a sample size of `r n`
```

Note that you need the space straight after the `r`.

We can also automatically say that the maximum value of the data is `r max(y)`, or round it to a
whole number: the maximum value of the data is `r round(max(y))`. These were done by:
```{r eval=FALSE}
the maximum value of the data is `r max(y)`

the maximum value of the data is `r round(max(y))`
```

**Show some of the data**

Let's combine the data in a tibble (think of it as a data frame if you don't
know what that is):

```{r showdata}
data <- tibble(x, y)
data
```

(only the first 10 rows get printed here thanks to dplyr).

To have a proper table, we can do
```{r kable}
kable(data[1:10,],
      caption = "The first rows of my data.")
```

(If you're running the code separately the exact style may look different
because of settings we have, but pretty much everything is tweakable with the
`kable` and `kableExtra` packages).

**Plot then fit a regression data**

Now to plot the data:

```{r plot, fig.alt = "Simple plot of the 50 simulated data points."}
plot(x, y)
```

To fit and then print the summary regression output from R:

```{r regression}
fit <- lm(y ~ x)
print(summary(fit))
```

And for a report we can produce a simple table (including a caption) of output and the regression fit:

```{r fit}
kable(coefficients(summary(fit)),
      caption = "Linear regression fit.")
```

And create a plot:
```{r plotfit, fig.alt = "Simple plot of the 50 simulated data points with the fitted regression added in red."}
plot(x, y)
abline(fit, col="red")
```

**Now, let's go back and change the data**

The *big* feature of dynamically generating reports is when you go back and
change or update the input data. For example, changing the data in the above
example and then re-running it to redo the report. The best way to demonstrate
this is for you to do it in Exercise 1.

### Exercise 1

1. In R do `library(rmarkdown)` to make sure you have the `rmarkdown`
   package. If not then install it with `install.packages("rmarkdown")`.

1. Download [rmark-exercise.Rmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quantitative-biology/module-2-rmarkdown/main/rmark-exercise.Rmd){target="_blank"}
   onto your computer and put it where you want to work on this exercise. Make
   sure it is saved as `rmark-exercise.Rmd` and not `rmark-exercise.txt`.

1. The file is an R Markdown (`.Rmd`) file that you can run by either doing
   `rmarkdown::render("rmark-exercise.Rmd")`
   in R, or clicking the `knitr` button in RStudio and selecting the `.html`
   option: TODO add Joe's figure.

1. Check that this has produced ('rendered') an `.html` file document that looks
   similar to what you
   see above (don't worry if the styling is not identical, but the important
   content should be). Note that the `.Rmd` file is _not_ repeating all the
   explanations that we gave above, but is a simplified version containing
   the commands, which is why the output won't be identical. (The exact R Markdown
   file, `module-2-rmarkdown.Rmd`, used to create what you are reading here is
   available on the [GitHub repository for this module](https://github.com/quantitative-biology/module-2-rmarkdown){target="_blank"}).

1. Carefully read through the `.Rmd` file and compare it with what you see in the
   resulting `.html`. There are some comments in there, denoted by
   `<!-- comment -->` to help you, but you should be able to get the idea of how
   commands in the `.Rmd` file translate into output in the `.html` file.

1. Copy the resulting `rmark-exercise.html` to `rmark-exercise-orig.html`, change `n` to 30 in `rmark-exercise.Rmd`,
   and re-render it.

1. Compare the two `.html` files. You have done the same analyses but on
   different data. You changed one value, `n`, and consequently all the
   resulting calculations changed, and these are all updated in your new `.html`
   document! You have performed exactly the same analysis on your 'new' data,
   including creating tables and figures. No copy-and-pasteing of tables, or
   manually keeping track of which figure corresponds to which analysis.

That last bit is the crux of R Markdown. Once you understand that then you
should incorporate it into your workflow. You can easily run identical analyses
on two data sets, or do 10 runs of a model with different parameters, and easily
compare the output.

You can even get a bit clever with your writing by including an R `ifelse`
statement to somewhat automate the text. Here is the results of some code (that
will be included in the file):

So the maximum value of $y$ is `r round(max(y))`, which is
`r ifelse(max(y)>400, paste("greater than"), paste("less than"))`
the special value of 400. The "greater than" or "less than" part is given by
```{r swanky, eval=FALSE}
`r ifelse(max(y)>400, paste("greater than"), paste("less than"))`
```

But you have to be careful and think about all possibilities -- what if
$y=399.9$?

## Output format

A feature of R Markdown is that you can create output in various different
formats, such as `.html`, `.pdf`, and `.docx` (if you are so inclined). This is
often touted as a great feature -- you can simply switch an argument in the
start of your code to switch output formats.

However, in practice, doing biological research and analyses, we have not found
the need to have the same piece of code switch from `.html` to `.pdf` output. If
you are writing a manuscript you are going to want it as `.pdf`, whereas if you
are writing a vignette for an R package (these are done in R Markdown) you will
probably want it as `.html`. The trouble with switching is that subtle
formatting tweaks may render differently in the different formats, and you may
end up spending a lot of time trying to make things work perfectly for two
outputs -- but in practice you may only really need, say, a `.pdf`.

So we would recommend choosing which output you are going to use (depending on
what you are writing your particular piece of code for), and then sticking with
that. For example, I prefer to do exploratory analyses as `.pdf` while others may prefer
`.html`.

To keep it simple, in Exercise 1 we set the output to be `.html`. For
scientific documents such as manuscripts and theses, a `.pdf` is preferable. We
will now demonstrate this, for this you will need LaTeX installed.

For decades, LaTeX has been the standard typesetting system for writing
mathematical papers. In 2002, Friedrich Leisch created the R package 'Sweave', to
weave together R code for calculations and LaTeX code for writing up results
into a `.pdf` file. (It was called `Sweave` because S was the precursor language to
R, plus I expect Sweave sounded better than
Rweave). Sweave motivated the R package `knitr` (to knit together R code with text write ups)
by Yihui Xie, which also allows html and other output formats. R Markdown was
then created to allow simpler use of `knitr`, without learning lots of LaTeX
commands, though you need LaTeX installed to use R Markdown.

### Exercise 2

Now download
[rmark-pdf-example.Rmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quantitative-biology/module-2-rmarkdown/main/rmark-pdf-example.Rmd){target="_blank"}
onto your computer and put it where you want to run it. As before, make
sure it is saved as `rmark-pdf-example.Rmd` and not `rmark-pdf-example.txt`.

Try running it as earlier, either using `rmarkdown::render("rmark-pdf-example.Rmd")`
in R, or clicking the `knitr` button in RStudio but selecing the `knit-as-pdf`
option. If it doesn't run then you
probably need to install LaTeX (you should get a helpful error message). See the
simple instructions in another book by Yhiui Xie et al., the [R Markdown
cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/install-latex.html){target="_blank"}.

Go through `rmark-pdf-example.Rmd` carefully, reading the notes in the comments,
and comparing the `.Rmd` code to the rendered .pdf. I get three warnings (not
errors) like `Package xcolor Warning: Incompatible color definition on input
line 283.` It seems to work so don't worry if you get them also.

Technial aside: Using those warnings as a teachable moment, this is why I set `keep_tex = TRUE` in the
YAML header of `rmark-pdf-example.Rmd`. When you render the document, the
`rmarkdown::render()` R function uses `knitr::knit()` to run the R code in your
`.Rmd` file, and then build a LaTeX `.tex` file, which is then run by Latex to
build a .pdf. It's good to be aware that there are several steps going on here,
especially when something doesn't work. The warning in the
previous paragraph is referring to line 283 of the `rmark-pdf-example.tex` file
(the `.tex` file, not the original `.Rmd` file). The default R Markdown setting
seems to be to delete the `.tex` file when everything builds okay, and so the
`.tex` file was getting deleted. So keeping the `.tex` file can be
helpful to try and debug warnings or errors that need fixing. Generally you want
to fix warnings when you first see them occurring, but sometimes you just have
to leave them in as everything seems to be working as intended (as is the case here).

Also, if you are using Git and GitHub then you would track the `.Rmd` file using
Git, but add the `.tex` file to your `.gitignore` file since it is an output
from the `.Rmd` file (there is no need for Git to track each version of it).

## Further reading

As we said, the idea of this module was to give you a simple introduction to
using R Markdown. The [Definitive Guide to
R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown){target="_blank"} is highly recommended (and
often where you end up when Googling for how to do something), but you do not
need to understand all of it (I know that Pandoc is doing stuff behind the
scenes, but have managed to not need much more than that). [Chapter
2](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/basics.html){target="_blank"} goes through the basics,
including many things that we glossed over above, such as more details about
YAML, the code between the `---` at the top of `rmark-exercise.Rmd` and
`rmark-pdf-example.Rmd`. It also explains how R Markdown, despite the 'R' in its
name, can also be used for computer languages other than R, such as Python, SQL,
Julia, C, and Fortran.

Also see the [RStudio
introduction](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html){target="_blank"} if
you use RStudio.

In practice, once you have something working in the style you like, you can just
copy those settings for each new project. It can be handy to keep a readme file
of containing commands/options/tips that you use a lot.
